# SimpleCalculator
Implemented basic html, css and javascript as a side project to apply what is taught in class. 
Takes input from the keyboard and clicking and evaluates simple mathematical expressions as shown on the calculator screen.
(uses eval function because code was written to implement basic understanding of link between html, css and javascript)
